# react-file-manager
A react remote file manager with Light Framework as back end file system. This is one of the admin tools that our customers manage their static files on shared host.

### Extract from the framework
I hope some day I can find time to extract it from the Light Framework and make it an independent application
so that it can be utilized by broader users.
